Practice repository for Externship 2022

# **Repository practiceâ€”here is the edit section for the github tutorial**

1. Complete the externship
2. Be a productive member of the engineering team
3. Profit
4. Go to Montreal in two weeks with my family

Second round of changes to a github repository using VSCODE instead of VIM.
As I mentioned previously, I'd like to avoid using the command line via terminal if at all possible.

This edit right here is to practice using the pull feature in VSCode.

Startup commands for this project:

source .venv/bin/activate (Activate virtual environment session)

Then, because for some reason the virtual environment doesn't recognize it was started in a folder's console:

python /Users/ajristino/Desktop/hello-world/mysite/manage.py runserver

This starts the django development server.
