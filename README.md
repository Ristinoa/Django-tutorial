# Django-tutorial
Practice repository for Externship 2022 â€” revised 2024

## **Info regarding this project:**

This is a Django tutorial I (A.J. Ristino) completed during November and December, 2022. 

The files stored in this repository are essentially just the baseline materials for an admin panel application built to the specifics of a tutorial given to me by an instructor.

### Startup commands for this project:

source .venv/bin/activate

(Activate virtual environment session)

Then, because for some reason the virtual environment doesn't recognize it was started in a folder's console:

python /Users/ajristino/Desktop/hello-world/mysite/manage.py runserver

This starts the django development server.
